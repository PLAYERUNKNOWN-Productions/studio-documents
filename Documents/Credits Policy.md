# Credits Policy

Creating credits for a project can sometime feel like arranging the perfect seating plan at a large family event. With competing priorities, various contributions, and personal preferences, balancing fairness and recognition is always a challenge. While everyone deserves a place at the table, deciding where and how to credit each person can become the subject of endless debate.

At PLAYERUNKNOWN Productions, we believe that every team member plays a vital role in bringing our project to life. As a small studio where everyone contributes at every stage - from initial concept to final feedback - we aim to credit all contributors fairly. We intentionally avoid a traditional hierarchical list, as our collaborative culture values shared effort over rigid roles.

To provide clarity and transparency in how we recognize our team's hard work, we've developed this Credits Policy. It isn't set in stone; it will evolve when needed to reflect our values and the contributions of our team members.

## Rule #1: Format
Contributors are credited using following format:
- **Native Name** (optional): The contributor’s name in their native language.
- **Display Name**: Typically, the contributor’s first name followed by their family name.
- **Nickname** (optional): How the contributor is known within the team. Nicknames must be approved by the project owner.

**Example**: 张三 - Zhang San - "Unknown"

**Note**: Displaying Native Name can sometime be technically challenging. In such cases, the Native Name may be omitted.

## Rule #2: Grouping and Sorting
Contributors are grouped by discipline.
Within each discipline, contributors are listed alphabetically by family name.
The project owner determines the order of disciplines.

## Rule #3: Single Section Credit
Contributors are only credited under one discipline.
If participating in multiple disciplines, contributor can choose in which discipline they want to appear in, generally the last one they contributed to.
Exception: Contributors without a production-related role who also contribute to production tasks may be credited in two disciplines.

## Rule #4: Eligibility
Contributors who worked on the project for 30 days or more are credited, even if they are no longer part of the project.
Contributors who participated for less than 30 days may be acknowledged in the “Thanks” section, at the project owner’s discretion.
External contributors, contractors and freelancers are credited under the same discipline or section as other contributors.
Exception: If a contract specifies different crediting terms, the credits comply to the contract.
All current employees of PLAYERUNKNOWN Productions (PP) who did not directly participate in the project are credited in the “PP Thanks” section.

## Rule #5: Visibility
Credits are shared with the team for review and necessary fixes before release. 
The credits are included in the game and/or in a file alongside the executable.
